## [0.2.3-preview] - 2018-12-17

### This is the first release of the *Unity Multiplayer HLAPI \<com.unity.multiplayer-hlapi\>*.

Initial release of the Unity Multiplayer HLAPI (or UNet HLAPI) moved into a package. This will
work with Unity 2019.1.0a12 and onwards.

This was previously an extension DLL but the layout has been moved from the extension style to a package format. Also all
parts which existed in the Unity engine (native code) have been moved out and utilize public API instead. Mostly
this involved
- Update bump is now created with a hidden game object, instead of registering in the player loop internally
- Domain reloads are detected with public APIs
- Weaver invocation (used for code generation) registers with the compiliation pipeline API and receives callbacks
  every time compilation finishes so it can parse the DLLs.
- Profiler panel functionality was made possible by making some internal APIs puplic for now.

Also, some runtime tests have been moved to the package as playmode tests.
